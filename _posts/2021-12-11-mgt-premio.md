Our post-doc lab member Maria Giulia Tullo has been awarded by the Society of Neuropsychology for the best Doctoral Thesis in the neuropsychology field.

Her doctoral thesis entitled *The causality of complexity: understanding higher human cognitive functions through dynamic interactions among brain regions* focused on the study of visual processing and visuomotor functions in a connectivity perspective. The usage of the Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) approach to assess brain connectivity between brain regions has contributed to shed light on the inter-regional circuits underlying these cognitive functions.
