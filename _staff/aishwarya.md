Second year student of Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience. I am curious, passionate and keen about all things neuroscience. I am excited to join the Brain Imaging Lab community, eager to learn from its members and contribute in any way I can. Outside of academia, you can often find me lost in the world of books, F1,  attending concerts, or enjoying a good movie.
